    <h2>How to play</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't let the ball touch the ground</li>
      <li>Don't play the ball with your hands</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Construction - Make your own</h2><img src="used_ball.jpg" width="25%" alt="used ball">

      <li>The underlying structure of a ball is an <a href=
                                                              "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosidodecahedron" target=
                                                              "_blank">Icosidodecahedron</a>, see the following Orthographic
        Projection:
      </li><img src=
                        "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Uniform_tiling_532-t1.png/800px-Uniform_tiling_532-t1.png"
                width="25%" alt="">
      <li>Materials:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>(4.5mm or your choice of size) rattan core</li>
        <li>Construction</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The main idea is by applying the fact that we can make
            the top of a box stay closed by using this
            pattern:</li><img src="box_fold.png" alt=
                "box folded on the top, each fold on top of the next">
          <li>The reason it holds is that one half is held down by
            the previous flap and the other side is on top of the next
            flap, holding the next one down, it can do this due to it's
            rigidity</li>
          <li>Each shape you see on the orthograpic projection will
            have the same property as folds on the top of the box. For
            example, we will have triangles where for each band
            involved in the triangle one side goes under a band and one
            side goes over a band. This gives the ball it's
            structure.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Repairing</li>
        <ul>
          <li>As you use the ball it will get worn down. Eventually
            one of the bands will start to break down and snap, this
            usually isn't a problem until you have at least 2 or 3
            bands breaking down. At the following point of wear in the
            image, I would replace the band</li><img src=
                                                             "band_damage.jpg" width="25%" alt="used ball">
          <li>Remove the old band (you can snap the band as you go),
            and just weave the new band in.</li>
          <li>By repairing your ball it actually becomes smaller and
            tighter, this makes the ball harder to break in the future.
            Also repairing one band once in a while is easier than
            making a whole new ball from scratch.</li>
